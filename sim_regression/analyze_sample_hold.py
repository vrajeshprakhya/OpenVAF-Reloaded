"""Measure the sample-and-hold run in sh_out.txt against VAMS-2023 5.10.3.1.

Two independent claims, both of which a working `@(cross)` has to satisfy:

  hold      `out` must not move between sample edges. This is the one that fails
            outright when `cross` takes no part in scheduling: the body runs on
            every evaluation, so `out` tracks the input.
  accuracy  the held value must be `v(in)` at the crossing *instant*, found by
            interpolating the clock through the threshold. Detecting the crossing
            on the first accepted step after it puts a floor under this: the event
            lands up to one timestep late, and the input has moved on by then.

Exits non-zero if either check fails.
